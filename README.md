# Tennis_simulator
It's a script that simulates tennis matches. Feel free to try it out! All you have to provide are the probabilities a player wins the point when he is serving.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.1.3: Improved probability input with error messages and option to input value as whole number or float. Display only games won per set in the final output.

Version 0.1.2: Introduced tiebreaks at the ends of sets. If the match goes to 5 sets the tiebreaker is a first to 10 point game instead of a first to 7 point tiebreaker. Also cleaned up the code by introducing some new methods to eliminate code duplication and grouped the methods of the class Match to improve readability.

Version 0.1.1: Corrected the switch of server on start of new set.

Version 0.1.0: Defines the basic logic of a tennis match between two players. This includes simulation of the most basic component of a tennis match **a point**. From a played point we then added additional components such as games and sets. The script asks for a simple input; the probability player serving wins the point. This input is for now very basic, but leaves room for improvement and more complex logic of how a point is played.
